# Security Monitoring Dashboard

A real-time cybersecurity threat monitoring dashboard with interactive visualizations for traffic analysis, threat mapping, and security event tracking.

## Features

- **Real-time Traffic Monitoring**: Live traffic volume visualization with baseline comparison
- **Global Threat Map**: Interactive world map showing threat indicators with severity levels
- **Animated Visualizations**: Pulsing threat indicators and smooth animations
- **Risk Classification**: Color-coded threat levels (High, Medium, Low)
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable to different screen sizes

## Threat Types Monitored

- DDoS Attacks
- Malware Detection
- Port Scans
- Data Breach Attempts
- Suspicious Traffic Patterns

## Visual Elements

### Traffic Chart
- Real-time request volume tracking
- Baseline comparison (50 req/min default)
- Current volume display
- Time-series visualization

### Threat Map
- Simplified world map with continental representations
- Animated threat indicators with pulsing effects
- Color-coded severity levels:
  - ðŸ”´ **High Risk**: Critical threats requiring immediate attention
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk**: Moderate threats requiring monitoring
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk**: Minor threats or normal security events

## Installation

1. Save the HTML file to your local machine
2. Open the file in a modern web browser
3. The dashboard will start automatically with simulated data

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- HTML5 Canvas for high-performance rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for optimal performance
- CSS3 for modern styling
- Real-time animation using requestAnimationFrame

### Performance Features
- Efficient canvas rendering
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Minimal DOM manipulation
- Optimized redraw cycles

## Data Sources

The dashboard currently uses simulated data for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would integrate with:

- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems
- Network monitoring tools
- Threat intelligence feeds
- Log aggregation systems
- Security APIs

## Customization

### Adding New Threat Types
Modify the `threats` array in the `drawThreatIndicators` method to add new threat types and locations.

### Adjusting Colors
Update the `colors` object in the threat indicator drawing function to customize severity colors.

### Baseline Configuration
Change the baseline traffic value by modifying the baseline display text and comparison logic.

## Security Considerations

- This is a monitoring dashboard only - it does not perform active security measures
- Ensure secure data transmission when connecting to real threat feeds
- Implement proper authentication for production deployments
- Regular updates of threat intelligence data recommended

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time data integration via WebSocket connections
- Historical data storage and analysis
- Alert system integration
- Export functionality for reports
- Multi-dashboard support
- User authentication and role-based access
